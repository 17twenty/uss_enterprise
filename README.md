Live Long and Prosper ðŸ–– implemented in a `Makefile`.

## Installation

Simply clone this repo to your local machine (the green button on GitHub could guide you). In order to run in it, you should have `make` installed, but I hope you already do.

## Usage

Type `make it so` in your terminal and engage!

## Notes

Yes, it's a joke. It is a byproduct of my article on `make` to illustrate
targets, dependencies and rules in `Makefile`.
